# Contributing 
Having standardized PRs are important, thus we will use the following style.

## Title:

1. Start with type of PR ie feat, bug, tech, style
2. In parenthesis say what portion of the app you changed ie auth, core, rides, etc
3. A short description of what the PR is for

Example:
> feat(auth): Pulls user data from google oAuth

## Body:

We will also have a standard body with the following format
```markdown
# Description
This allows for a more detailed explanation of everything in the PR, images are good to have also

# Steps to Reproduce
The steps that someone needs to do to verify the PR is correct

# Tested
Talk about what tests were written, and if there needs to be more testing

# Approved
Who needs to approve the PR before being merged

```
